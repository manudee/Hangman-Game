# Hangman-Game

Here I have my Hangman_game with a theme as "Around the world with Hangman".

You will be presented with a word to guess on the screen when the game starts.
You have 10 guesses at the beginning of the game.

Try to guess the letters as you go.

Here are some Rules:
1. For each correct letter you press , I will be revealing them on the screen.
2. If you guess it incorrectly, you will lose 1 guess from the total remaining guesses at that point.
3. Try to guess the word before you run out of all guesses.
4. If you guess a letter that has already been guessed in the game before, you will not see any updates on the screen.
   Don't worry I will not reduce your total guesses for a wrong guess you made the 2nd time.
5. If you are able to guess the word correctly before you run out of guesses, You WIN!!
6. On the other hand, if you use all your guesses and still don't come up with the word- You Lose! :(

HINT: Words are from the group (countries or continents)

Happy playing!!
